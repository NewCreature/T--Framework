T^3 Framework (T3F) is a framework which simplifies the process of making games
with Allegro 5. It handles event processing for you and provides you with easy
access to input, sound, and graphics. Several modules are included in addition
to the core framework. These provide functions for input binding, animation,
collision detection, menu handling, sprite atlasing, and more.
