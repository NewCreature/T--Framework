T3F Issues
----------

[ ]Automatically handle Windows->UTF-8 conversion for strings passed through
   compiler flags. I think extended ASCII might map correctly to UTF-8
   characters 128-255.

[ ]Reorganize template build scripts. The makefile.* scripts should be in a
   scripts folder instead of src. The main Makefile and makefile.defines
   should be in the root of the project. Ideally, src will just contain the
   project's source code files.

   [ ]I'm not sure if this is possible without making the scripts more
      convoluted. If we can get the scripts to execute with src as the working
      folder, then it should work without having to change how we write our
      definitions in makefile.defines.

[ ]Define T3F_OBJECTS in build scripts to include all T3F object files for the
   build platform. If there are platform specific objects, these should be
   included here also. We can probably define T3F_CORE_OBJECTS to be all
   objects for every platform and T3F_PLATFORM_OBJECTS to be objects for the
   build platform.

[ ]Define T3F_LIBRARIES in build scripts to include all libraries needed for
   T3F to work.

[ ]See about using pkg-config on all platforms that support it so we can
   simplify our build scripts.
