T3F To-Do List
--------------

[ ]Finish mapper.

   [ ]Add ability to insert an empty layer.
   
      [ ]Inserted layer should have same properties as the selected layer.
   
   [ ]Add ability to change a layer's x/y offset.
   
   [X]Deleting a tile should fix the tilemap's references to it and subsequent
      tiles. References to the deleted tile should be set to 0. The rest should
      be changed to reflect the new location of the tiles in the tileset.
      
   [ ]Need a way to define animated tiles.

[ ]Finish animation implementation.

   [ ]See about allowing frames to be rotated (should be pretty easy).
   
   [ ]Make sure frame positioning and rotation works for t3f_draw_*_animation().

[ ]Finish collision tilemap implementation.

   [ ]Need to fix curved/sloped floors.
   
      [ ]Add functions to detect distance from point to solid collision tile.
      
         [ ]When programming a game with curved floors we can use these
            functions to determine if we want the object to change from grounded
            to airborn.

[ ]Add support for joystick hotplugging.

[ ]Add fixed point math collisions. Should have both float and ALLEGRO_FIXED
   versions.

[ ]Add demo games.

[ ]Make HTML manual.

[ ]Use primitives to draw vectors instead of lines. This should speed up the
   vector engine dramatically.

[X]Move 3D functionality into t3f.c.

   [X]Change T3F_3D_STATE to T3F_VIEW.
   
   [X]Set default projection at t3f_initialize().
   
      [X]Provide t3f_default_view.
      
   [X]Rename functions to t3f_draw_*_bitmap to match Allegro 5's functions.

[X]Move sprite sheet functionality into t3f.c.
   
[X]Add some basic colors like T3F_COLOR_WHITE so we don't always have to map
   colors when drawing stuff.
   
[X]Prefix hyperlink functions with t3f_.

[X]Add support for static layers and full image layers.

[X]Finish implementing controllers.

   [X]Make sure we can map axes properly.
   
   [X]Implement some configuration options such as dead zone.
   
[X]Create T3F_SPRITE_SHEET type and use that for creating sprite sheets instead
   of the current begin/end style.
   
   [X]Might test new idea for sprite sheets using memory bitmaps and then swapping
      out pointers when the sprite sheet is finalized. This would require passing
      double pointers to the sprite sheet functions so when we finalize the original
      bitmap pointers can be swapped with the new ones.

[X]Add mouse mickeys functions.

[X]Hyperlink menu items should be clickable by default. Remove T3F_HYPERLINK_FLAG_CLICKABLE
   and add T3F_HYPERLINK_FLAG_STATIC.

[X]Change t3f_initialize() parameters to put program name first.

[X]Finish tilemap editor.

   [X]Copy editor from Balloon Boy.
   
   [X]Add help.

[X]Implement a flag to disable alpha channel in tilemap layers. This is so the
   user can decide if they want to draw their own backdrop or use the tilemap
   as the backdrop.

[X]Clean up for release.

   [X]Build tools with same makefile as examples.
   
   [X]Clean up template program.
   
   [X]Proofread documentation.
   
   [X]Remove unused sources.

[X]Simplify the tilemap rendering routines.

   [X]Get rid of T3F_TILEMAP_CAMERA and use the current view instead. It doesn't
      make sense to force a camera system on the user when they will probably
      want to make their own with whatever features they want to use.
   
      [X]Pass camera coordinates to t3f_render_tilemap().
   
   [X]Get rid of option to render the full map as that is a game-specific thing
      and should be done there instead (PP2 should implement its own rendering
      function to generate previews).
      
[X]Add ability to pass a color to the tilemap rendering routines so we can do
   some basic effects.

[X]Document tilemap functions.

[X]Add collision example.

[X]Paper Paddle demo game should use the GUI system.
   
[X]Fix music player. Currently it is possible to play multiple music files
   simultaneously if you play them too quickly.

[X]Prepare license.

[X]Document collision module.

[X]Create a test tilemap for ex_tilemap.

   [X]Add a cloud layer to the map so we can see some of the "3D" effects.

[X]Put in demo games.

   [X]Implement gameplay for Dot to Dot: Sweep.
   
      [X]Adjust amount of balls per level to correct difficulty curve.
   
   [X]Add intro screen to Anti-Virus.
   
      [X]Show game controls on intro screen.
